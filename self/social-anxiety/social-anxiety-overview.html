    <h1>Social Anxiety Overview</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>In order to overcome a problem it is important to understand what is keeping it going.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>What is Social anxiety?</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Socail Anxiety is a shorthand term that describes the fear, nervousness and apprehension most people at
            times experience in their relationships with other people</li>
        <li>Some people who suffer from social anxiety would say they were shy and may have been shy all of their lives
        </li>
        <li>Social anxiety strikes people when they think they might do something that will be humilating or
            embarrassing</li>
        <li>Social anxiety makes people think they are judging you and doing so in a negative way because of something
            you said or did.</li>
        <li>The fear that you will do something humiliating or embarrassing is inhibiting</li>
        <li>It will make your self-conscious aware of the possibility that you might indeed so such a thing</li>
        <li>Who would want to get into a converation if they thought that doing so would only reveal their clumsiness or
            inadequacy</li>
        <li>Socially anxious people tend to assume their interactions with others will be painfully revealing that
            others will notice their weaknesses, that they will be dismissed, ignored, criticised or rejected for not
            behaving more acceptably</li>
        <li>Seeing things this way makes it hard to interact naturally with people and difficult to talk, listen or make
            friends.</li>
        <li>Often it leads to isolation and loneliness, and for so many people one of the sadnesses of suffering from
            thsi problem is that it prevents them from being intimate with other people, or finding a partner to share
            their lives</li>
        <li>Socially anxious people usually feel friendly towards others and have their fair share of the positive
            characteristics that other people appreciate</li>
        <li>They may have a sense of fun, be engergetic and generous, kind and understanding, serious, amusing, quiet or
            lively and spontaneously behave in these ways if they feel at ease.</li>
        <li>Feeling at ease in company is hard for them, and makes them so anxious, that these qualities are hidden from
            view</li>
        <li>Soically anxious people may have lost belief in their likeable qualities together with their self-confidence
        </li>
        <li>One of the rewards of learning to overcome social anxiety is that it enables you to express aspects of
            yourself that may previously have been stifled</li>
        <li>It allows you to enjoy, rather than to fear being yourself</li>
        <li>Overcoming anxiety allows you to rediscover or even discover yourself</li>
        <li>As you come to realise that no-one's social behaviour is perfect and everyone makes mistakes</li>
        <li>Mistakes are fine - they are only part of being human so there is no needs to let them under-mine you.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Defining the problem</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Social anxiety is normal and everybody geels it sometimes so everyone knows to some degree what it is like
        </li>
        <li>Seeking a total cure would be attempting the impossible</li>
        <li>Becoming less self-conscious can make a big difference and reducing pain and distress which helps you live
            the life you wish to live</li>
        <li>The main four criteria<ol>
                <li>
                    A persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to
                    unfamiliar people or possible scrutiny by others
                </li>
                <li>The individual fears that he or she will act in a way that will be embarrassing and humilating [note: people with social phobia may not actually do anythinh humilating or embarrassing - they only fear that they will</li>
                <li>Exposure to the feared social situations almost invariably provokes anxiety</li>
                <li>The precise things that someone with Social Anxiety Disorder fears differ from person to person, having to do these things are always difficult for them</li>
                <li>The person with SAD recognises that the fear is unreasonable or excessive</li>
                <li>You know that the things that make you anxious are not really dangerous and they may hardly bother other people at all</li>
                <li>SAD can make you feel unconfident, indaequate or inferior as well as anxious</li>
                <li>The feared situations are avoided or else endured with intense anxiety and distress</li>
                <li>It is only natural then it makes sense in terms of self-protection to avoid or escape from frightening protection</li>
                <li>people with SAD do not want to be lonely and isolated and they cannot control the sources of their fear</li>
                <li>People with SAD want to work, make friends and feel that they belong just as much as others, so they may endure difficult situations despite the distress that they feel, and focus on keeping the risks or threats as small as possible, the intensity of the anxiety they feel makes the stratergy seem only sensible</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
